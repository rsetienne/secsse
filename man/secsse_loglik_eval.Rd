}
\arguments{
\item{parameter}{list where first vector represents lambdas, the second
mus and the third transition rates.}

\item{phy}{phylogenetic tree of class \code{phylo}, rooted and with
branch lengths. Alternatively, multiple phylogenetic trees can be provided
as the \code{multiPhylo} class.}

\item{traits}{vector with trait states for each tip in the phylogeny. The
order of the states must be the same as the tree tips. For help, see
\code{vignette("starting_secsse", package = "secsse")}. When providing a
\code{multiPhylo} set of multiple phylognies, traits should be a list where
each entry in the list corresponds to the matching phylogeny on that
position.}

\item{num_concealed_states}{number of concealed states, generally equivalent
to the number of examined states in the dataset.}

\item{cond}{condition on the existence of a node root: \code{"maddison_cond"},
\code{"proper_cond"} (default). For details, see vignette.}

\item{root_state_weight}{the method to weigh the states:
\code{"maddison_weights"}, \code{"proper_weights"} (default) or \code{"equal_weights"}.
It can also be specified for the root state: the vector \code{c(1, 0, 0)}
indicates state 1 was the root state. When
using a \code{multiPhylo} object, root_state_weight should be list where each
entry in the list corresponds to the root_state_weight for each tree.}

\item{sampling_fraction}{vector that states the sampling proportion per
trait state. It must have as many elements as there are trait states. When
using a \code{multiPhylo} object, sampling fraction should be list where each
entry in the list corresponds to the sampling proportion for each tree.}

\item{setting_calculation}{argument used internally to speed up calculation.
It should be left blank (default : \code{setting_calculation = NULL}).}

\item{loglik_penalty}{the size of the penalty for all parameters; default is
0 (no penalty).}

\item{is_complete_tree}{logical specifying whether or not a tree with all its
extinct species is provided. If set to \code{TRUE}, it also assumes that all
\emph{all} extinct lineages are present on the tree. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{num_threads}{number of threads to be used. Default is one thread.}

\item{atol}{A numeric specifying the absolute tolerance of integration.}

\item{rtol}{A numeric specifying the relative tolerance of integration.}

\item{method}{integration method used, available are:
\code{"odeint::runge_kutta_cash_karp54"}, \code{"odeint::runge_kutta_fehlberg78"},
\code{"odeint::runge_kutta_dopri5"}, \code{"odeint::bulirsch_stoer"} and
\code{"odeint::runge_kutta4"}. Default method is: \code{"odeint::bulirsch_stoer"}.}

\item{num_steps}{number of substeps to show intermediate likelihoods
along a branch.}
}
\value{
A list containing: "output", observed states along evaluated time
points along all branches, used for plotting. "states" all ancestral states
on the nodes and "duration", indicating the time taken for the total
evaluation
