\usage{
create_lambda_matrices(
  state_names,
  num_concealed_states,
  transition_list,
  model = "ETD",
  concealed_spec_rates = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state_names}{vector of names of all observed states}

\item{num_concealed_states}{number of hidden states}

\item{transition_list}{a matrix containing a description of all speciation
events, where the first column indicates the source state, the second and
third column indicate the two daughter states, and the fourth column gives 
the rate indicator used. E.g.: ["SA", "S", "A", 1] for a trait state "SA"
which upon speciation generates two daughter species with traits "S" and "A",
where the number 1 is used as indicator for optimization of the likelihood.}

\item{model}{used model, choice of "ETD" (Examined Traits Diversification) or
"CTD" (Concealed Traits Diversification).}

\item{concealed_spec_rates}{vector specifying the rate indicators for each
concealed state, length should be identical to num_concealed_states. If left
empty when using the CTD model, it is assumed that all available speciation
rates are distributed uniformly over the concealed states.}
