\title{Function to simulate a tree, conditional on observing all states.}
\usage{
secsse_sim(
  lambdas,
  mus,
  qs,
  crown_age,
  num_concealed_states,
  pool_init_states = NULL,
  maxSpec = 1e+05,
  conditioning = "none",
  non_extinction = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  max_tries = 1e+06,
  drop_extinct = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambdas}{speciation rates, in the form of a list of matrices}

\item{mus}{extinction rates, in the form of a vector}

\item{qs}{The Q matrix, for example the result of function q_doubletrans, but
generally in the form of a matrix.}

\item{crown_age}{crown age of the tree, tree will be simulated conditional
on non-extinction and this crown age.}

\item{num_concealed_states}{number of concealed states}

\item{pool_init_states}{pool of initial states at the crown, in case this is
different from all available states, otherwise leave at NULL}

\item{maxSpec}{Maximum number of species in the tree (please note that the
tree is not conditioned on this number, but that this is a safeguard against
generating extremely large trees).}

\item{conditioning}{can be 'obs_states', 'true_states' or 'none', the tree is
simulated until one is generated that contains all observed states 
('obs_states'), all true states (e.g. all combinations of obs and hidden
states), or is always returned ('none').}

\item{non_extinction}{should the tree be conditioned on non-extinction of the
crown lineages? Default is TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{provide intermediate output.}

\item{max_tries}{maximum number of simulations to try to obtain a tree.}

\item{drop_extinct}{should extinct species be dropped from the tree? default
is TRUE.}
}
\value{
a list with four properties: phy: reconstructed phylogeny,
true_traits: the true traits in order of tip label, obs_traits: observed
traits, ignoring hidden traits and lastly:
initialState, delineating the initial state at the root used.
}
\description{
By default, secsse_sim assumes CLA-secsse simulation, e.g.
inheritance of traits at speciation need not be symmetrical, and can be
specified through usage of lambda-matrices. Hence, the input for lambdas
is typically a list of matrices.

Simulation is performed with a randomly
sampled initial trait at the crown - if you, however - want a specific,
single, trait used at the crown, you can reduce the possible traits by
modifying 'pool_init_states'.

By default, the algorithm keeps simulating until it generates a tree where
both crown lineages survive to the present - this is to ensure that the tree
has a crown age that matches the used crown age. You can modify
'non-extinction' to deviate from this behaviour.
