# secsse 3.0.0

Version 3.0.0 is expected to arrive to CRAN in the second half of 2023. It 
extends the C++ code base used for the standard likelihood to the "cla_"
likelihood, harnessing the same computation improvement. 

## Breaking changes
* Function name changes:
    * `create_lambda_matrices()` is now called `create_lambda_list()`
    * `create_transition_matrix()` is now called `create_q_matrix()`
    * `create_mus()` is now called `create_mu_vector()`
    * `create_default_q_list()` is now called `create_default_shift_matrix()`
    * `create_default_lambda_list ()` is now called `create_default_lambda_transition_matrix()`
    * `create_default_q_list()` is now called `create_default_shift_matrix()`
* Package data files renamed: 
    * `phylo_Vign` is now called `phylo_vignette`
    * `traitinfo` is now called `traits`
    * `phy` is now called `example_phy_GeoSSE`
* `plot_state_exact()` argument `steps` renamed to `num_steps` and argument 
`focal_tree` renamed to `phy` for consistency with other functions.

## Major changes

* Vastly improve the computational speed of "cla_" likelihood calculation.
* Optimization of parallelization resulting in better scaling with more threads
and faster run time for standard secsse and cla_secsse likelihood calculations.

## Minor changes
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Documentation reworked into `default_params_doc()`.
* Several documentation formatting improvements and linking. Documentation now
follows and allows for roxygen2 markdown.
* Two new vignettes:
    * _Using secsse with complete phylogenies (with extinction)_ `vignette("complete_tree", package = "secsse")`
    * _Secsse versions_ `vignette("secsse_versions", package = "secsse")`
* Revise, combine and simplify the _Using SecSSE ML search_ and _Setting up a 
secsse analysis_ into the _Starting secsse_ vignette 
`vignette("starting_secsse", package = "secsse")`.
* `secsse_sim()` argument `conditioning` now defaults to `"obs_states"` from 
`"none"`.
* No longer Import package 'stringr' and Suggest package 'testit'.
* New organisation of code in .R, .cpp and .h files. (Developer side).
* Start archiving in Zenodo, with new .zenodo.json metadata file.

## Bug fixes
* `secsse_sim()` fix bug causing error when simulating trees with extinct 
species.

# 2.6.0

## Major changes
* C++ code base for the standard likelihood, making smarter use of
parallelization, this marks another 10-fold increase in speed.

## Minor changes
* Add a number of helper functions: `fill_in()`, `create_default_q_list()`, 
`create_default_transition_list()`, `create_mus()`
* Implemented necessary changes to comply with CRAN clang16 build and solve
issue with the boost odeint library uninitialized variable 
(see https://github.com/boostorg/odeint/issues/59 and more details at 
https://github.com/rsetienne/DAISIE/pull/158)
* Updated Copyright license to the Boost Software License, Version 1.0 for 
included C++ code (R code remains GPL>=3).

## Bug fixes
* Fix memory leaks

# 2.5.0
Version 2.5.0 appeared in 2021 on GitHub and was published in May 2023 on CRAN.
Version 2.5.0 marks the first version using C++ to perform the integration,
and it used tbb (from the RcppParallel package) to perform multithreading. This
marks a ten fold increase in speed over previous versions.
Secondly, 2.5.0 introduces the function `secsse_sim()` to simulate a 
diversification process using the (cla) secsse framework.
Lastly, in version 2.5.0 functions were added to allow visualisation of 
inferred rates of speciation across the tree (e.g. `plot_state_exact()` and
`secsse_loglik_eval()`).

# 2.0.0
Version 2.0.0 appeared in June of 2019 on CRAN and extended the package with the
cla framework, e.g. including state shifts during speciation / asymmetric 
inheritance during speciation. 

# 1.0.0
The first version of secsse appeared in January of 2019 on CRAN. It used the
package deSolve to solve all integrations, and could switch between either using
a fully R based evaluation, or use FORTRAN to speed up calculations.
Furthermore, using the foreach package, within-R parallelization was
implemented. However, parallelization only situationally improved computation
times, and generally, computation was relatively slow.
