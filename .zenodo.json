	"description": "<p>SecSSE is an R package designed for multistate data sets under a concealed state and speciation (hisse) framework. In this sense, it is parallel to the 'MuSSE' functionality implemented in diversitree, but it accounts for finding possible spurious relationships between traits and diversification rates ('false positives', Rabosky & Goldberg 2015) by testing against a 'hidden trait' (Beaulieu et al. 2013), which is responsible for more variation in diversification rates than the trait being investigated. <\/p>",
